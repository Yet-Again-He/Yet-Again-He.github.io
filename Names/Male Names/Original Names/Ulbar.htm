<p><b>Ulbar</b>.&nbsp; “Noble (one) of reflection”</p>



<p>He lived at the beginning

of the Golden Age (about S.A 900). &nbsp;He joined Aldarion (later

Tar-Aldarion) on his fateful voyage which led to the breakdown of his

marriage.&nbsp; Despite originally being a sheepherder Ulbar became a trusted

man under the prince, to the point he was his sole companion alongside one

other in the prince’s trip towards Hyarnastorni and his wife.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the meaning

is strange, his name does make a certain amount of sense if one accounts for

his role in the unfinished tale of <i>Aldarion and Erendis</i>, where he serves

as a mirror for Aldarion, where everything is technically the same but with the

results reversed.</p>
