<p><u>Song of Finrod’s Battle with Sauron</u></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p><b>Ukirrina lirên an sapthânî,</b></p>
<p><i>He chanted a song of wizardry,</i></p>

<p><b>An  an sapthânî,</b><i><br>



Of piercing, opening, of treachery,<br>



Revealing, uncovering, betraying.<br>



Then sudden Felagund there swaying<br>



Sang in answer a song of staying,<br>



Resisting, battling against power,<br>



Of secrets kept, strength like a tower,<br>



And trust unbroken, freedom, escape;<br>



Of changing and of shifting shape,<br>



Of snares eluded, broken traps,<br>



The prison opening, the chain that snaps.<br>



Backwards and forwards swayed their song.<br>



Reeling and foundering, as ever more strong<br>



The chanting swelled, Felagund fought,<br>



And all the magic and might he brought<br>



Of Elvenesse into his words.<br>



Softly in the gloom they heard the birds<br>



Singing afar in Nargothrond,<br>



The sighing of the sea beyond,<br>



Beyond the western world, on sand,<br>



On sand of pearls in Elvenland.<br>



Then the gloom gathered; darkness growing<br>



In Valinor, the red blood flowing<br>



Beside the Sea, where the Noldor slew<br>



The Foamriders, and stealing drew<br>



Their white ships with their white sails<br>



From lamplit havens. The wind wails,<br>



The wolf howls. The ravens flee.<br>



The ice mutters in the mouths of the Sea.<br>



The captives sad in Angband mourn.<br>



Thunder rumbles, the fires burn –<br>



And Finrod fell before the throne.</i></p>
