<p><u>Apostles’ Creed</u></p>

<p><i>I believe in One God, the
Father almighty, creator of heaven and earth and all things visible and
invisible.</i></p>

<p><i>And in one Lord Jesus Christ,
son of God, the only begotten, born of the father before all ages.</i></p>

<p><i>Light of Light, true God of
true God, begotten, not made, of one substance with the father,</i></p>

<p><i>Through whom all things were
made.</i></p>

<p><i>Who for us men and for our
salvation came down from heaven, </i></p>

<p><i>and was incarnate from the
Holy Spirit, and Mary the virgin, and became man.</i></p>

<p><i>He was (also) crucified for
us under Pontius Pilate, and suffered and was buried.</i></p>

<p><b>Uzula izri (day)nud,
makhalbêthîyô.</b></p>

<p><i>And He rose again on the
third day, according to the Scriptures.</i></p>

<p><b>Uzula minalada kanada aphâm
pâ-zê ‘nÊru attû,</b></p>

<p><i>And he ascended into heaven,
and sits at the right hand of God the Father.</i></p>

<p><b>Karô unakha aglar-mâ angadâ
râdi ka-aganim, kathâni ‘hhu rô bâ nêg.</b></p>

<p><i>And he will come again with
glory to judge the living and the dead, and of his kingdom there will be no
end.</i></p>

<p><b>kaNaha zôr, Khôr, dibdân
‘nrâd, mana nakha attûwô,</b></p>

<p><i>And in the Holy Spirit, the
Lord and giver of life, who proceeds from the Father and the son,</i></p>

<p><i>Who (together) with the
father and the son is worshiped and glorified, who spoke through the prophets.</i></p>

<p><b>Îr, phanna, kâtha,
ka(apostolic church).</b></p>

<p><i>In one, holy, catholic, and
apostolic church.</i></p>

<p><i>I profess one baptism for the
remission of sins.</i></p>

<p><b>Karâd anaban nakha, izinda.</b></p>

<p><i>I expect the resurrection of
the dead, and the life of the world to come, amen.</i></p>
