//////////// Words /////////////
B.S. 'nazg' (ring).  Tolkien himself stated that it was inspired by old gaelic 'nasc' (ring).

S/Ad. 'aglar' (glory).  It not only shares the same consonantal sequence as 'glory', but even shares the exact same consonantal
formation (glVr).

S.  'luin' (blue) resembles and seems to have a linguistic connection to old gaelic 'luin' (waves).

Ad.  'beth' shares physical similarities with the Hebrew word bet(h).

Ad.  'Gimel' in Psalm 119 means discernment, perception, perceptiveness, and wisdom.  This seems to be somewhat
related to Ad.  'gimil', which is a collective noun for "stars", which were heavily associated with seeking wisdom,
and require great perception to see.

Ad. 'phêl' is from the root form PHIL, which is similar in sound and usage to French 'fille'.

Ad. the root full-form of 'Attô' ("father") is TATA, which is latin for "father".  Also similar to Kyrgyz 'Atta"

Ad. the full-form of the root of 'Ammê' ("mother") is MAMA, no need to explain the similarities there XD.

Ad.  'rôth' ("foam, white crest of waves) is reminiscent of archaic english "wroth", an intense form of
being rageful or wrathful with the imagery of spittle or foam associated with it.
