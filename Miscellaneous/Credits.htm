<p>Neo-Adûnaic Lexicon Credits</p>



<hr size=1 width="100%" noshade style='color:black' align=center>



<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Paul Strack, Tolkien language scholar whose ongoing
compilation of all of Tolkien’s languages and words made this possible, as well
as his help in grammatical formation.</p>

<p>Thorsten Renk, whose “<i>ni_bitha_adunaye”</i>
started me on learning Adûnaic, and whose speculative work in pronouns enabled
me to complete their presence without resorting to endless invented words.</p>

<p>Special thanks to my sister Sophie for her scholarly
and phonetic help.</p>

<p>And last but most certainly not least, Peter Crijins
and his own forays and assistance into and with Adûnaic grammar and roots.</p>
