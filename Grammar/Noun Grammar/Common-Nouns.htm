<h1>Common Nouns</h1>

<hr size=1 width="100%" noshade style='color:black' align=center>

<p>Common nouns are used to denote creatures, people,
and races when no gender is specified.&nbsp; They are useful in their ability
to be converted to <b><a href="Masculine-Nouns.htm">Masculine-nouns</a> </b>using
<b>-û</b> or <b>-ô</b>, or <b><a href="Feminine-Nouns.htm">Feminine-nouns</a></b>
with <b>-î</b> or <b>-ê</b>.</p>

<p>Using a similar formation to, they usually use [a] as
their last vowel, and cannot use [-î/-ê] or [-û/-ô] as an ending vowel.&nbsp;
However, the last rule cannot</p>

<p><u>Characteristics</u></p>

<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Similar
to <b><a href="Neuter-Nouns.htm">Neuter-nouns</a></b> in formation.</p>

<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Prefer
neutral [a] as their last vowel.</p>

<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Cannot
use [-î/-ê] or [-û/-ô] as an ending vowel unless it is the base vowel (only
possible with a biconsonantal root base).<sup>[1]</sup></p>

<p>[1].&nbsp; This actually applies to when the word is
originally formed from its root.&nbsp; This means that so long as the original
form of the word even as far back as primitive Adûnaic did not incorporate the
gendered suffixes, it could “evolve” into using one of those long vowels
naturally (e.g. <b><a href="../../Words/Nouns/manô.htm">manô</a></b>, which is
actually Common-gendered.&nbsp; It came from the late primitive Adûnaic word <i>manau</i>,
which came from the early primitive word <i>manaw</i>).</p>
