<h1>Collective Nouns</h1>

<hr size=1 width="100%" noshade style='color:black' align=center>

<p><b>Collective Nouns</b> in Adûnayân is an informal tense, where each noun represents all examples of a concept, unlike the normal
plural form of a singular noun, which represents a select group of that concept.  As they exist more as a tense of the normal singular noun 
representing the concept, than an independent word, <i>they cannot be inflected in normal usage</i> (though one <i>may</i> use the objective with it for
a name if need be).</p>

<p>Due to its relative unimportance within the language, it is believed by some to exist either as a relic from one of the Edainic languages,
or perhaps the result of influence from other widely spoken languages among the Númenóreans, such as Sindarin with its similar <b>Class Plural</b> tense.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Examples</b>:</p>

<p><i>kulub</i>, “all edible vegetable roots,” versus <i>kulbu</i>, “root,” or the plural form <i>kulbî</i>, “roots.”</p>

<p><i>gimil</i>, “all the stars,” versus <i>gimli</i>, “star,” or the plural form <i>gimlî</i>, “stars.”</p>
