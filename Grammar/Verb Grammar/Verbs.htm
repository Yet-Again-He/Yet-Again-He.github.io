<h1>Verbs</h1>

<p>Verbs are different from nouns in that they must
adhere to their shapes strictly.  Declining verbs is differentiated based on
their shape, of which there are three:</p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p><b>Triconsonantal Verbs:</b></p>

<p>They must always follow the form CVCVC as their
normal tense.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Biconsonantal Verbs:</b></p>

<p>They must always follow the form CVC, no exceptions.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Derived Verbs:</b></p>

<p>They have the loosest structure, but they cannot have
more than three consonants and their last vowel must be an <i>-â</i>.</p>
