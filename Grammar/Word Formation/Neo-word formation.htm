<p>Neo-Adûnaic Word Formation.</p>

<p>Fair warning, these are deductions made by the
community based off patterns in his works, so we will never know for certain
whether this was what the renowned author would have wished.</p>

<p><u>Overview</u></p>

<p>From its inception until the sundering of the
Faithful and the King's men, the languages most beloved within Númenor were the
elven languages, especially among the elites and nobles. This, along with
Primitive Adûnayân's rather underdeveloped phonetics, paints a picture of a
language originally utilized as a backup tongue, one that everyone can speak if
need be due to their heritage but otherwise given little regard. This seems to
have led to a simplistic (or perhaps foundational?) approach to the language,
from its grammar to its words. Very strong rules with little deviation for
maximum ease of understanding. For a semi-agglutinative language, it is easy to
decipher, at times not unlike taking basic Lego pieces and attaching them to
make something else.</p>

<p>Having been relegated to the background from the
beginning of Númenor, the tongue necessarily developed a more vulgar feel to
its sounds.  However, it still seeks to emulate the </p>

<p>The words, too, are not only easy on average to
figure out due to the heavy adherence to biconsonantal/triconsonantal
formations, they attempt to be Onomatopoeic of the concept whenever possible
(like the classic example karab for &quot;horse&quot;, which conjures the sound
of a horse gait). Even when the language became the tongue for everyone
following the end of the Golden age of Númenor, it still retained the
simplistic look towards its usage, the structure still heavily tilted towards
logical understandability in contrast to the understanding via beauty
interwoven through the elven languages, or perhaps the information density
structured into Modern English.  Fundamentally vulgar in tone, its speakers
still developed and modulated its usage for an ease and fluidity of speaking
that may rival Sindarin or Quenya, giving it a lyrically harsh feel to the
language.</p>

<p><b><u>Rules</u></b></p>

<p><u>Onomatopoeia.</u></p>

<p>This means that when it comes to animals, sounds, or
various objects with sounds associated with them, their name should evoke
memories of that sound (such as <i>karab</i> for horse, which evokes the
thought of a horse galloping).</p>

<p>Exceptions to the rule is where the creature or object
is one naturally shunned and rather not talked about, then it tends to have a
name identical or nearly so in sound to an elvish word for it (such as <i>uruk</i>
for “orc”).</p>

<p>A corollary to this is the association of -<i>u-</i>
and <i>-ô-</i> with stronger/darker themes, while <i>-i-</i> and -<i>ê-</i>
tend to be with lighter, more feminine themes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>Two-vowel Minimum.</u></p>

<p>While a word can end up with as little as one consonant,
the word must always have the minimum of two vowels in a word, even if it is in
the form of a long vowel.&nbsp; Some examples are <i>katha</i> (“all”), <i>ûri</i>
(“sun”), or <i>pâ</i> (“hand”).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>No more than three consonants!</u></p>

<p>Adûnaic is a composite bi/triconsonantal word
system.&nbsp; In other words, the base word <i>cannot</i> have more than three
consonant sounds.&nbsp; The only way to bypass the limit is to either form a
word from multiple words or add a suffix onto the base word (such as agental
and verbal suffixes).</p>

<p><b>Example</b>:<i> pharaz + -ôn</i>
(“gold” + adjectival suffix) à <i>pharazôn</i> (“golden”).&nbsp; <i>huzun
+ -dâ</i> (“ear” + verbal suffix) à <i>huznudâ</i> (“to
hear”).&nbsp; <i>Katha + phazag- + -ân</i> (“all” + “to rule” + agental suffix)
à
<i>kathuphazgân</i> (“conqueror, (lit.) all-ruler”).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>Standalone Suffixes.</u></p>

<p>Words meant to be used as a suffix should by default
be only one short vowel, (unless you have an <i>-e-</i> or an <i>-o­-</i>,
which in that case it’s long by default).</p>

<p>If used as a standalone word, the base vowel must be
lengthened if necessary.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Occasionally, you may want to forge a triconsonantal
word whose base and variable vowels do not agree, <i>and</i> cannot be
explained away as a-fortification (i.e. <i>burôda</i>, “(very) heavy”) or some
other normal process.&nbsp; In such a process, it is recommended to insure that
in base form, the two vowels will form a recognized Adûnaic diphthong (e.g. <i>târik</i>,
“pillar” à âi).&nbsp; The one exception to the rule is words
with a base vowel -i- and secondary vowel -a- (e.g. <i>minal</i>, <i>zidar</i>,
“sky” and “poise” respectively).</p></html>
