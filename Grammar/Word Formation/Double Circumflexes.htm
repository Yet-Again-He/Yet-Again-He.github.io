<p>Having two or more long vowels</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This rule is highly speculative but based on patterns
observed in Tolkien’s original Adûnaic words.</p>

<p>[e] and [o] are always long, unless you have pair of
either with no different vowel in between, then you speak each one in short
form since together they make a long vowel.<sup>[1]</sup></p>

<p>one or more consonants in between them does NOT make
a difference, you can have a consonant cluster like in <i>igmil</i> and the
rule will still apply to [e] and [o].</p>

<p>If there are two [o]s together, each is then reduced
to short form, since together they make a long [&#333;] that just happens to
have a consonant inside it (for example, <i>obroth</i>, “fore-wake”).</p>

<p>If there are two [e]s together, treat each one as a
short vowel, since together they make a long [&#275;] (for example, <i>izreneth</i>,
“beloved woman”).</p>

<p>Note this does not apply if there are two long vowels
of different kinds next to each other, such as an [&#275;] and an [&#333;], or
an [&#333;] with a [&#257;], or any other combination.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>[1].&nbsp; This does not apply if one of the two long
vowels in question is the ending vowel for a Weak-II/Strong-II word, such as <i>lôkho</i>,
since it does not suffer from vowel congestion.</p></html>
