concerning the Men of the West.</p>

<p><b>Usage of the Lexicon</b></p>

<p>This Lexicon is not intended to be a complete
replacement for Mr Strack’s <i>Eldamo</i>, most certainly not at this early
stage of compilation.  Instead, its main, current function is to act as an enlarged
dictionary, housing both original and neo-word formations, along with some grammar
articles expanding on known knowledge to cover more situations than one can
necessarily extrapolate from the original grammar.</p>

<p>It also has an ever expanding list of names for people
to use for anything from fiction to real life, just make sure to talk to the speakers
on appropriate choices or on making new names!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Which version of Adûnaic is adapted for
the Lexicon?</b></p>

<p></p>
<p>Here are the currently determined likely sources of various words:</p>
<p>Scholarly and scientific words from Quenya, occupying the position of English's Greek terms and some Latin. Quenya was the language of lore.</p>
<p>Legal, military and general "educated" words from Sindarin, occupying the position of English's Latin terms and some French. The upper classes spoke Sindarin for a long time.</p>
<p>Metalworking terms: pre-Beleriand Khuzdul borrowings for basics, Sindarin for Elvish techniques, Quenya for the highest Noldorin technology. I imagine 
that the Dwarves weren't using Khuzdul around Men by the time the Edain arrived in Beleriand, or there would be more Khuzdul in there.</p>
<p>Animal and plant names: pre-Beleriand Avarin and Silvan borrowings, plus any purely Mannish ingredient</p>
Agriculture: Initial influence possibly from Silvan and Sindarin, otherwise most of it may be due to a probable Entwife origin for Edainic agricultural words, 
both before they crossed the Blue Mountains in the First Age, as well as Entwives met on the journey from Hildórien in the far east.</p>
