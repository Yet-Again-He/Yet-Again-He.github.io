<p><b>Usage of the Lexicon</b></p>

<p>This Lexicon is not intended to be a complete
replacement for Mr Strack’s <i>Eldamo</i>, most certainly not at this early
stage of compilation.  Instead, its main, current function is to act as an enlarged
dictionary, housing both original and neo-word formations, along with some grammar
articles expanding on known knowledge to cover more situations than one can
necessarily extrapolate from the original grammar.</p>

<p>It also has an ever expanding list of names for people
to use for anything from fiction to real life, just make sure to talk to the speakers
on appropriate choices or on making new names!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Which version of Adûnaic is adapted for
the Lexicon?</b></p>

<p>For the newcomer, there are in fact three conceptual
stages of Adûnaic as Tolkien revised his approach to the native tongue of Númenor. 
The stages are lettered as follows: k-, d-, and a-Adûnaic.  Being focused on
the Classical period of Adûnaic (right before the fall of Númenor), the lexicon
is based upon d-Adûnaic, which also has the greatest source on grammar for the
language.  It would indeed be better to use a latter evolution of the language
whenever possible, but that is unfortunately impossible in this case, since a-Adûnaic
has too little information, and what information there is frequently
contradicts earlier writings for no apparent reason.&nbsp; That said, there
will be influences of a-Adûnaic within the work, since it is not entirely
exclusive of earlier works.&nbsp; For those worried about its influence, do not
worry as it will only appear as addendum rules concerning prepositions and long
vowels in special situations.</p>
